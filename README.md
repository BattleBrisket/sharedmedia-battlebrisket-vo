BattleBrisket VO for LibSharedMedia
===================================

Over **280** tactical voiceover callouts loaded into `LibSharedMedia` for World of Warcraft. Intended for use with other addons, including **WeakAuras**.

Covers many movement & ability mechanics tracked by dungeon/raid encounters addons and weakaura sets. Drop-in replacement for any other dungeon/raid sound set.

All lines are recorded by a Real Human--US English male voice, no AI generation--and mastered for a suitably epic sound fitting your WoW gameplay.

[A complete list of callouts](https://github.com/BattleBrisket/sharedmedia-battlebrisket-vo/blob/master/callout-list.txt) in plain text is available from the repository.

Sounds are prefixed with `BB` and color highlighted, as shown below:
